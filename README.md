# BidirectionalMR
Focused method for Bidirectional causal inference

Code for the paper "A Focusing Framework for Testing Bi-Directional Causal Effects with GWAS Summary Data" by Sai Li and Ting Ye.

"Focused-Main.R" includes the main functions for the proposed methods. 

"Focused-example.R" includes a real data example for testing bi-directional causal effects between body mass index and type 2 diabetes.

"Simu-4experiments.R" is the simulation code for replicating the results in Section 5 of the paper.

"BidirecMR-raw-4experiments.R" and "BidirecMR-raw-4experiments-ldl.R" are the simulation code for relication the results in Section F.2 of the paper.
